## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-17

This release bundles two strands of work:

1. The **parity and runtime-compatibility upgrade** (PR #5 by @Garou11) — see "Parity & runtime semantics" below.
2. An **OSS-readiness pass + architectural deepening** (PR #6) — see "Pipeline, HelperUsage, and 95% coverage gate" below.

### Pipeline, HelperUsage, and 95% coverage gate

- **Composable transpilation pipeline** — `src/pipeline.ts` exposes
  `parse`, `extractMetadata`, `generateBody`, `buildFactory`,
  `buildStandaloneFactoryCode`, and `compile` as individually-callable
  stages. `transpileToPineJS` and `transpileToStandaloneFactory` both
  collapse to thin wrappers around the pipeline; the CLI consumes
  the same surface. External tooling (LSPs, linters, custom backends)
  can compose stages without re-wiring Lexer→Parser→MetadataVisitor→
  ASTGenerator→buildIndicatorFactory inline.
- **`HelperUsage` tracker** (`src/generator/helper-usage.ts`) — the
  generator records which preamble helper categories (math, session,
  StdPlus, array, map, matrix, color, string, utility, state) it
  emits, and the factory builder reads the tracker directly via
  `IndicatorFactoryOptions.helperUsage` instead of grepping the
  transpiled body for marker substrings. The legacy
  `analyzeRequiredHelpers` string-scan remains as a fallback for
  direct external callers of `buildIndicatorFactory` /
  `generateStandaloneFactory` that bypass the pipeline.
- **GitHub issue templates** in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` —
  `bug_report.md`, `transpilation_failure.md`, and a `config.yml`
  that disables blank issues and points to Discussions.
- **`engines.node`** pinned to `>=18.0.0` in `package.json`.
- **`prepublishOnly`** script — runs `typecheck`, `lint`, `test`,
  `build` before any `npm publish`.
- **95% coverage gate** — `bun run test:coverage` invokes
  `scripts/check-coverage.ts`, which parses Bun's coverage table and
  exits non-zero when aggregate line or function coverage drops below
  95% (currently 95.81% functions / 98.62% lines).
- New unit tests for `pipeline`, `helper-usage` (classifier + tracker
  + emission integration including the new `matrix` and `state`
  categories), `executePineJS`, CLI commands (real
  `commandTranspile` / `commandValidate` / `commandInfo` invocation
  with stubbed `process.exit`), CLI utils, mapping reflection
  helpers, math helpers, and stub namespaces.
- **`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`** enforcement contact replaced the
  `[INSERT CONTACT METHOD]` placeholder with the GitHub Security
  Advisory URL.
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** Discussions link normalised to the canonical
  `Opus-Aether-AI` GitHub org slug. Setup commands switched from
  `pnpm` to `bun`.
- **README**: documented the new pipeline API, helper-usage tracker,
  coverage gate, and refreshed the architecture diagram to call out
  the five stages.
- **Repo layout**: moved hand-edited reference docs (`LIMITATIONS.md`,
  `CORPUS-BASELINE.md`) into `docs/`. The script-generated parity
  matrices stay in root because the scripts in `scripts/corpus/`
  write to those paths.
- Stale CHANGELOG entry referencing an `@opusaether/pine-transpiler/llm-prompt`
  export that was never shipped (confirmed via `git log -S`) removed.
- Redundant `.npmignore` deleted (the `files` whitelist in
  `package.json` already constrains the published tarball).

### Parity & runtime semantics

Major parity and runtime-compatibility upgrade focused on making PineScript
execution behavior closer to TradingView for real-world indicators.

### Added
- **Strict numeric parity audit** (`bun run corpus:strict`) with deterministic
  checks for SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, ATR, BB, KC, CCI, MFI, WPR, and ROC.
- **67-indicator parity matrix** (`bun run corpus:matrix`) with grouped
  coverage output in `INDICATOR_TEST_MATRIX.md`.
- **TradingView Top-100 matrix** (`bun run corpus:tv100`) with
  lane/authenticity/source splits in `TRADINGVIEW_TOP100_MATRIX.md`.
- **TradingView Top-200 matrix** (`bun run corpus:tv200`) covering
  top-100 plus 100 additional popular/custom fixtures in
  `TRADINGVIEW_TOP200_MATRIX.md`.
- **Corpus manifest layer** (`tests/corpus/manifest.ts`) with per-fixture
  metadata: source, lane, authenticity, category, and inferred feature tags.
- **Corpus stability gate** (`bun run corpus:gate`) with configurable
  per-lane and per-authenticity budgets for CI.
- **Chart safety gate** (`bun run chart:safety`) that enforces
  TradingView-like host contracts across fixtures:
  constructability via `new indicator.constructor()`, per-bar plot output
  shape guarantees (declared length, no `undefined`, numeric slots), and
  visual event payload integrity checks with failure artifacts in
  `.tmp/chart-safety/`.
- **Matrix API support (`matrix.*`)** via new mappings/helpers:
  `matrix.new`, `rows`, `columns`, `get`, `set`, `add_row`, `remove_row`.
- **Persistent state helpers** for Pine semantics:
  `_pineVar`, `_pineSetVar`, `_pineVarip`, `_pineSetVarip`.
- **Runtime session/time bindings** for `session.ismarket`,
  `session.ispremarket`, `session.ispostmarket`, `time_close`,
  `time_tradingday`, and `timestamp`.
- **New regression suites** for request-security behavior, state semantics,
  time/session semantics, and drawing-handle method compatibility.
- **Visual style semantics in runtime event stream**: `__visualEvents`
  entries now carry normalized `style` metadata (`colors`, `transp`,
  `linewidth`, `offset`, `display`) for visual parity diagnostics.
- **Expanded visual baseline fixtures** for phase-14.2 coverage:
  `41-visual-drawing-lifecycle.pine`,
  `42-visual-table-scanner.pine`, and `ict-killzones.pine`.
- **TradingView-shaped harness package export** (`@opusaether/pine-transpiler/test-harness`)
  with focused descriptor + reducer-survival runtime checks.
- **Harness fixture lane** for startup/runtime regression guards:
  `fixtures/trivial-sma.pine`, `fixtures/ict-killzones.pine`, plus
  integration suites `tests/integration/tradingview-descriptor-contract.test.ts`
  and `tests/integration/tradingview-reducer-survival.test.ts`.

### Changed
- **`request.security` moved from unsupported to partial support**:
  runtime now passes through the `expression` argument (including tuple
  expressions), plus deterministic higher-timeframe bucket merge subset;
  true full MTF parity remains out of scope.
- **Drawing/table namespaces upgraded** from warning stubs to stateful
  runtime-compatible handle objects (`line.*`, `box.*`, `label.*`, `table.*`)
  with mutator/getter behavior (still no visual rendering).
- **Visual parity artifact/report schema expanded** with aggregated visual
  style semantics and additional lifecycle call counters for
  line/box/label/table method families.
- **Runtime/diagnostic harnesses aligned to host semantics**:
  strict-audit, visual-artifact, debug-fixture, and regression helpers now
  instantiate indicator constructors with `new` to mirror chart behavior.
- **Corpus report output expanded** with lane/authenticity/category pass
  rates and top feature coverage sections.
- **Named-argument emit behavior** now passes value-only arguments in runtime
  calls, preventing assignment-style side effects while preserving call values.
- **TA series argument handling** now wraps series-aware inputs correctly
  (`_series_<source>` or `context.new_var(...)`) for mappings that need series.
- **`ta.cci` mapping corrected** to source+length, series-aware signature.
- **`ta.vwap` mapping switched to `StdPlus.vwap`** for scalar/tuple compatibility.
- **`math.sum` helper renamed** from `_sum` to `_pineSum` to avoid
  user-symbol collisions.
- **Build outputs now include `dist/test-harness/*`** and package sub-export
  wiring for both ESM and CJS consumers.

### Fixed
- **`var`/`varip` assignment correctness**: persistent declarations and later
  reassignments now update shared runtime state correctly across bars.
- **Parser generic-call ambiguity**: `<...>` generic parsing no longer
  misclassifies ordinary comparison expressions.
- **Parser/lexer resilience on real scripts**:
  - if-expression parsing improved
  - keyword-like member properties (e.g. `syminfo.type`) supported
  - comma-chained statement/declaration forms handled
  - block parsing tolerant of leading blank/comment lines
  - newline continuation improved for leading-operator and ternary-colon lines
- **Plot metadata extraction parity**:
  - `plotarrow` now extracted and counted as declared output
  - dynamic `hline(...)` values are preserved in metadata extraction
- **Historical helper safety net**: missing `_getHistorical_*` references now
  receive generated NaN fallbacks to avoid runtime crashes on edge scripts.
- **`box.set_border_width` runtime compatibility** added to box stubs so
  drawing-heavy scripts no longer throw when mutating border width.
- **Indicator constructor contract parity**:
  `buildIndicatorFactory` now emits a constructable function and binds
  `this.main` under `new`, matching chart host expectations.
- **`plotchar` / `plotshape` metainfo style alignment**:
  emitted `metainfo.styles[plot.id]` and `metainfo.defaults.styles[plot.id]`
  now include `location`, preventing reducer crashes on
  `styles[plot.id].location.value()`.
- **Timezone/dayofweek compatibility path** for scripts that call
  `dayofweek(timestamp, timezone)` in host environments expecting
  session context.

### Quality / CI
- CI quality checks now include `bun run corpus:strict`,
  `bun run corpus:matrix`, `bun run corpus:gate`,
  `bun run chart:safety`, and `bun run test:harness`.
- Current verified parity baseline in this change set:
  - corpus full pass: **237/237**
  - parse-clean: **237/237**
  - indicator matrix: **67/67**
  - TradingView top-100: **100/100**
  - TradingView top-200: **200/200**
  - strict numeric parity: **11/11**
  - visual parity baseline: **8/8**
  - gate status: **PASS**

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-25

Major correctness pass driven by a real-world Pine corpus (40 curated
fixtures + 52 community fixtures scraped from public GitHub repos).
Curated pass rate **100%**, community pass rate **64%** (from a fake
"86%" baseline that turned out to be silent failures masked by a
runner heuristic).

### Added
- **Corpus framework** (`tests/corpus/`, `scripts/corpus/`) — fixtures,
  snapshots, mock PineJS runtime, deterministic synthetic OHLCV bars,
  per-fixture pass/fail walker, markdown report aggregator, scrape
  tool that pulls v5/v6 scripts from GitHub.
- **`__pineJsBody`** non-enumerable property on the returned
  `IndicatorFactory` exposing the literal transpiled JS body. Enables
  editor consumers to render the compiled output without
  `factory.toString()`.
- **Pine v6 `const` keyword** as a typed declaration introducer
  (`const color buyColor = color.blue`).
- **Compound assignment operators** (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`).
- **User-defined type annotations** in declarations and type fields
  (`Imbalance_Settings settings`, `Imbalance[] imbalance`).
- **`float[]` / `int[]` array type suffixes** on built-in types.
- **Comma-separated multi-decl** on a single line (`bool a = true,
  bool b = false`).
- **`map.*` mappings** (Pine v6) with `_mapNew` / `_mapPut` /
  `_mapGet` / `_mapContains` / `_mapRemove` / `_mapSize` /
  `_mapKeys` / `_mapValues` / `_mapClear` / `_mapCopy` /
  `_mapPutAll` and a runtime helper string injected on demand.
- **`array.new` alias** (Pine v6 generic syntax).
- **Static `MyType.new(...args)`** factory method on every
  emitted user-type class.
- **Real `barstate.*`**: `islast` / `isfirst` / `isnew` / `ishistory` /
  `isrealtime` / `isconfirmed` driven by per-bar context, replacing
  the hardcoded stubs.
- **Drawing-primitive metainfo types**: plotshape → `'shapes'`,
  plotchar → `'chars'` (with its own ParsedPlot type), bgcolor →
  `'bg_colorer'`.
- **Multi-output destructuring registry entries** for `ta.bb`,
  `ta.bbands` (alias), `ta.kc`, `ta.supertrend` alongside the
  pre-existing `ta.macd` and `ta.dmi`.

### Fixed
- **Named arguments dropped** — `plot(close, color=color.purple)` was
  emitting `Std.plot(close, color = color.purple)` which JS read as
  an *assignment expression* that rewrote the local `color` (the
  COLOR_MAP). Subsequent calls to `color.orange` then crashed on
  "undefined is not an object". Now strips named-arg pairs from the
  runtime emit; metadata visitor still consumes them via `getArg`.
- **StdPlus state caching** — `macd`, `hma`, `wpr`, `ao` cached
  derived series on `ctx._<x>_series` and called `.set()` on
  subsequent bars. PineSeries.set() OVERWRITES rather than appending,
  so the cached series stayed at length 1 and EMA/WMA over it
  returned NaN forever. Replaced with `ctx.new_var(value)` per bar.
- **Multi-line user functions** (`fn(args) =>\n<INDENT>body`) now
  correctly emit a `return` for the trailing expression statement
  (Pine implicit return).
- **Two consecutive `if` blocks** in the same indent level no longer
  swallow the next statement — `parseIfStatement` was eagerly
  consuming any KEYWORD to check if it was `else`.
- **Switch as expression / function body** parses correctly. Same
  bug pattern (`match` consumed any OPERATOR before checking value)
  appeared in `parseTernary`, `parseSwitchStatement`,
  `parseTypeDefinition` field-init, `parseFunctionDeclaration`
  param-default. All fixed.
- **`for i = 0 to N`** emits the increment `i++` (was empty,
  guarded only by the iteration ceiling).
- **`na(x)`** is a function call, not a NaN literal — was emitting
  `NaN(x)` which JS tried to call as a function.
- **Lexer line continuation**: NEWLINE suppressed inside `()`, `[]`,
  `{}` (multi-line calls) and after a trailing operator/comma
  (mid-expression continuation). `=>` is excluded — it ends a line
  intentionally.
- **Multi-block let-twice errors** — generator now emits `var`
  instead of `let` for top-level decls. JS's `var` allows
  redeclaration at the same scope, matching Pine's semantics where
  each `=` is a sequential write.
- **Catch-fallback false positives** — corpus runner used to
  silently merge mock plot output with the factory's
  `plots.map(_p => NaN)` synthetic on script throw, masking real
  errors. Factory now tags the synthetic with non-enumerable
  `__caughtError`; runner checks the tag and propagates.
- **Compilation errors propagate** — the `compiledScript = () => {}`
  no-op stub on `new Function` failure is replaced with a `throw`
  that routes through the per-bar runtime catch, so the corpus /
  consumer sees the real error.

### Wrapper bindings
The factory's `compiledScript(...)` parameter list expanded
substantially. Pine identifiers that real-world scripts reference
are now bound:
- `barcolor`, `request`, `array`, `time`, `bar_index`, `hour`,
  `minute`, `second`, `year`, `month`, `dayofmonth`, `dayofweek`
- `chart`, `format`, `string`, `xloc`, `yloc`, `extend`, `position`,
  `text`, `display`, `ticker`, `shape`, `location`, `size`
- `alertcondition`, `alert`
- `request.*` and bare `array` are no-op proxies returning an
  Iterable<NaN> so multi-tf destructure
  `[a, b, c] = request.security(...)` doesn't crash on
  "number is not iterable".
- `chart` / `format` / `string` / `ticker` are callable proxies so
  Pine's type-cast-style usage (`string(x)`) works alongside
  `chart.fg_color` member access.
- `str.*` stub expanded to: `tostring`, `tonumber`, `length`,
  `contains`, `startswith`, `endswith`, `upper`, `lower`,
  `replace_all`, `trim`, `split`, `pos`, `substring`, `format`.
- `timeframe.change(tf)` and `timeframe.in_seconds()` stubs.

### Build / tooling
- Migrate from pnpm + vitest to **bun + bun:test** (832 tests pass).
- **`prepare` script** added so a Git URL install (e.g.
  `github:Opus-Aether-AI/pine-transpiler#v0.2.0`) auto-builds the
  `dist/` on the consumer side.
- TypeScript bumped to ^6.0.3, Vite to ^8.0.10, Biome to ^2.4.13.
